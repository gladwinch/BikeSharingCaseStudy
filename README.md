# Project Overview
Bike Sharing Demand Analysis: BookBikes Case Study

## Problem Overview
BoomBikes, a bike-sharing provider in the US, is facing a significant decline in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the current market challenges, sustaining operations has become difficult. The company aims to devise a strategic business plan to boost revenue post-pandemic, as the economy begins to recover.

## The key objectives include:

Identifying the main factors that influence bike-sharing demand.
Understanding the extent to which these factors predict demand.

## Project Objective:
The goal is to create a model that predicts the demand for shared bikes using various independent variables. This model will help the management team to grasp how demand changes with different factors, enabling them to tailor their business strategies to match demand and meet customer expectations. Additionally, the model serves as a valuable tool for understanding demand trends in new markets.

## Key Findings
Developed a model that predicts bike-sharing demand with an R-squared accuracy of 0.88, indicating a strong fit between the model and the actual data.

## Tools and Technologies
Python
